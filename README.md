# peer-programing-code-editor

In the current era of remote work environments, the concept of peer programming is reduced to sharing a common codebase and going back and forth with changes, or in best case getting on a zoom meet and screen sharing.
We want to remove the hindrance and give developers the power of peer programming in an online environment.

This online application allows developers to set up their react project in an online code editor and code at the same time.

Application will work as follows:

1. Setting online code works similar to any online code-editor e.g. codepen or codesandbox etc.
2. Project is pre-configured with react setup similar to create-react-app structure.
3. Peer/Parallel code editing will work similar to google docs where multiple user can access the same codebase structure and make edit at the same time.

This application will allow developers to set up their react project in an online code editor and code at the same time on a single codebase simultaneously.

Following is the tech-stack around which the application revolves.

#### 1. ReactJS

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

#### 2. NodeJs/ExpressJs

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

#### 3. Typescript

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

#### 4. JWT Token Authentication

JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.

#### 5. Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic.

#### 6. MongoDB and Mongoose

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License which is deemed non-free by several distributions.

Mongoose is a JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a connection between MongoDB and the Express web application framework.

#### 7. Styled Components

Styled-components is a popular library that is used to style React applications. It allows us to build custom components by writing actual CSS in JavaScript.

#### 8. React Icons

Provides popular icons form ReactJs projects, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows us to include only the icons that project is using.

#### 9. Ant Design

A design system for enterprise-level products. Following the Ant Design specification, we developed a React UI library antd that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

#### 10. Axios

Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

#### 11. JOI

Schema description language and data validator for JavaScript

#### 12. Socket.io

Socket.IO is an event-driven JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.

#### 13. React Hook Form

React Hook Form is a library that helps you validate forms in React. It is a minimal library without any other dependencies, while being performant and straightforward to use, requiring developers to write fewer lines of code than other form libraries.
React Hook Form reduces the amount of code we need to write while removing unnecessary re-renders.

#### 14. Yup

Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, validate the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations, or value transformations.
