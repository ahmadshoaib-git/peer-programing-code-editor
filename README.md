# peer-programing-code-editor

This application will allow developers to set up their react project in an online code editor and code at the same time.

Following is the tech-stack around which the application revolves.

#### 1. ReactJS

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

#### 2. NodeJs/ExpressJs

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

#### 3. Typescript

#### 4. JWT Token Authentication

JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.

#### 5. Redux Toolkit

MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License which is deemed non-free by several distributions.

Mongoose is a JavaScript object-oriented programming library that creates a connection between MongoDB and the Express web application framework.

#### 7. Styled Components

Styled-components is a popular library that is used to style React applications. It allows us to build custom components by writing actual CSS in JavaScript.

#### 8. React Icons

Provides popular icons form ReactJs projects, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows us to include only the icons that project is using.

#### 9. Ant Design

A design system for enterprise-level products. Following the Ant Design specification, we developed a React UI library antd that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

#### 10. Axios
